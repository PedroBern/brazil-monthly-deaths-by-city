Installation
------------

First install the package:

.. code:: bash

    pip install brazil-monthly-deaths

Then install the chrome driver in order to use selenium, you can see
more information in the `selenium
documentation <https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers>`__
and the `chrome driver download
page <https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads>`__.


Usage
-----

    Assuming you have installed the chrome driver

.. code:: python

    from brazil_monthly_deaths import brazil_deaths, data, update_df

    # data is the data from 2015 to 2020
    print(data)

    # Everyday there are new records,
    # so you should get the most recent data.
    # Depending on your internet connection
    # it may take up to 6 minutes for each month
    # if you run for all states. Consider selecting
    # only the states you want to work on.
    new_data = brazil_deaths(years=[2020], months=[5])

    # update the lagging data provided by this package
    current_data = update_df(data, new_data)
    print(current_data)

API

Dataframes
~~~~~~~~~~

This package exports some
`pandas <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>`__ dataframe with the
following columns:

-  city\_id : unique integer from state and city,
-  year : from 2015 to 2020,
-  month : from 1 to 12,
-  region : [North, Northeast, South, Southeast, Center\_West],
-  state : one of the 27 states of Brazil, including country capital,
-  city : city name
-  deaths : number os deaths

.. code:: python

    from brazil_monthly_deaths import (
      data, # full data
      data_2015,
      data_2016,
      data_2017,
      data_2018,
      data_2019,
      data_2020 # always out of date, you need to update it
    )


brazil\_deaths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use this function to scrap new data directly from the `Civil
Registry Offices
website <https://transparencia.registrocivil.org.br/registros>`__. Just
make sure you have installed the chrome driver, as pointed above.

Official note about the legal deadlines:

    The family has up to 24 hours after the death to register the death
    in the Registry, which, in turn, has up to five days to perform the
    death registration, and then up to eight days to send the act done
    to the National Information Center of the Civil Registry ( CRC
    Nacional), which updates this platform.

It means: **The last 13 days are always changing.**

.. code:: python

    from brazil_monthly_deaths import brazil_deaths

Since it will access an external website, it will depend on your
internet connection and world location. Consider selecting only the
``states`` you want to work on. For each month, for all states it may
take up to 6 min to run for a single year.

.. code:: python

    df = brazil_deaths(
        years=[2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020],
        months=range(1, 13, 1),
        regions=_regions_names,
        states=_states,
        filename="data",
        return_df=True,
        save_csv=True,
        verbose=True,
        *args,
        **kwargs
    )  

The ``_regions_names`` is:

.. code:: python

    ["North", "Northeast", "South", "Southeast", "Center_West"]

The ``_states`` is:

.. code:: python

    [
      "Acre", "Amazonas", "Amapá", "Pará", 
      "Rondônia", "Roraima", "Tocantins", "Paraná",
      "Rio Grande do Sul", "Santa Catarina", "Espírito Santo",
      "Minas Gerais", "Rio de Janeiro", "São Paulo",
      "Distrito Federal", "Goiás", "Mato Grosso do Sul",
      "Mato Grosso", "Alagoas", "Bahia", "Ceará",
      "Maranhão", "Paraíba", "Pernambuco",
      "Piauí", "Rio Grande do Norte", "Sergipe"
    ]

The ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` are passed down to
``df.to_csv(..., *args, **kwargs)``


update\_df
~~~~~~~~~~

Use this function after you have scraped recent data from the Civil
Registry Offices website to update the data provided in this package.

.. code:: python

    from brazil_monthly_deaths import brazil_deaths, data, update_df

    new_data = brazil_deaths(years=[2020], months=[5])
    current_data = update_df(data, new_data)

It basically put the new data below the old data in the dataframe, then
remove the duplicates (excluding deaths) keeping the most recent
entries.


get\_city\_id
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get the unique id of the combination of the ``state`` and ``city``.

.. code:: python

    from brazil_monthly_deaths import get_city_id

    sao_paulo_id = get_city_id(state='São Paulo', city='São Paulo')

    print(sao_paulo_id) # 89903871
